# Rental-System
Implemented on localhost server using XAMPP using PHP and mySQL in order to create a very basic user-friendly way to manage a sample car rental database.


-- The sql file contains create statements for all necessary relations with some pre-loaded data.
-- The php files are all transactions the user can choose to take in relation with the database. HTML is used and it is a very basic user interface.
    The index.php file is the starting point.
